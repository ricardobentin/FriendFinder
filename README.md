# FriendFinder

FriendFinder is an application that users can use to find like-minded friends. Each user will answer 10 questions in a survey and then be matched to a friend who answered the survey in a similar fashion.

To get started, you can either go here: https://infinite-garden-37349.herokuapp.com/

run npm install in your CLI to load the required packages.

Required Packages

From there, run node server.js in your terminal

The application has two HTML pages:
* Home:

* /api/friends - which will display a JSON of all possible friends
